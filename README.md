# Interface Module

The goal here is to create a small web application that provides a user interface for educative modules. It needs to use React, Redux, Redux-saga and have to follow ES6.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Running

To run the web application, open a Terminal in the `build` folder and type:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 2000`

Then, open `http://localhost:2000/` in a internet browser.
